# Uni Management System For Chamran Uni

This is a management system for the education affairs of a university.
In this system, you can have information such as information about professors, students, course offerings, unit selection programs, student grades, and the average grade point average of a student's course, and ranking, etc.
This project is written in Python, and its code-first approach makes it much smoother and easier to create its database structure.
In this project, SQLite 3 and SQL Alchemy were used to design the database structure.
This project was created entirely individually and its credits are in my possession.

The complete content of the program code is in the main file and its sample databases are in the db file.
